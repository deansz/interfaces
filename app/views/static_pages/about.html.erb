    Social media provides a framework of interactions on which a user can build their online identity (Hogan, 2010). However, this framework can lead to the userâ€™s online identity becoming fragmented and falsified. 
    Particularly in young people, the discordances of creating an identity online are often not recognized or discussed. 'Image crafting' is a term that acknowledges the way we carefully curate our online persona.
    This project aims to create discussion about how we use social media to create identity, 
    through the use of interactive portraiture. The website will present facts about social media use and ask questions of the viewer relating to these facts, with subtly animated illustration to create engagement, interest and emphasis.  
    Through this, the process and perils of creating an identity online are exposed in a visual format. </p><br><br><hr></div>
