<h1>Theory</h1>
			<p>Inter_Faces facts are based on actual, real-life scholarly articles. Underpinning the whole project is a bunch of post-modern theory about who we are and how we present ourselves. In short, this theory says that basically our identities are not one fixed thing: they’re fluid, fragmented things defined by our interactions with others. Erving Goffman posited in 1959 that we present a ‘front’ of our personality when interacting with others, and that other stuff goes on ‘backstage’. This analogy makes a lot of sense when applied to the way we interact online: our online self becomes a ‘front’ for our offline self. I also looked at some recent theories that have emerged since social media has become popular, including Bernie Hogan’s idea that social media provides a framework of interactions on which a user can build their online identity.
